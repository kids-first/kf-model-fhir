    "- `baseDefinition` - this points to the `StructureDefinition` that the current one extends. It doesn't have to be one of the base FHIR definitions. It could be a `StructureDefinition`   from any FHIR data model. This is one of the features of FHIR that helps achieve interoperability.\n",

    "- `fhirVersion` - the FHIR semantic version number is required. It will instruct  anything validating this resource to use R4 (4.0.0) validation logic.\n",
    "- `differential` or `snapshot` - Every `StructureDefinition` must have either a `differential` - a section of content that specifies differences from the base definition, or a `snapshot` section which specifies the full definition. For model development, you almost always use the `differential` section and not the `snapshot`."
