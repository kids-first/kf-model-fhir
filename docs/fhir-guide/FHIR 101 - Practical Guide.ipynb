    "\n",
    "Since extensions are defined in their own files, they can be reused in a plug and play fashion by other models. We will see this later in the tutorial when we reuse the `karyotypic-sex`extension defined by the [Phenopackets FHIR model](https://aehrc.github.io/fhir-phenopackets-ig/).\n",

    "Perhaps you too feel this is a confusing topic in FHIR because you've heard various words used in association with Terminology in FHIR. \n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably heard the words/phrases: code, coding, codeable concept, Value Sets, etc and are wondering what they all are.\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will help you understand exactly what these terms mean, how they differ, and how they can be used in your FHIR model. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Terminology or an Ontology?\n",
    "Let's start with the very basics. A data model at its core is really just a collection of concepts and how they relate to each other. \n",
    "\n",
    "**An example - biological sex**\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept describes some entity in the world or an attribute of some entity in the world. For example, in our model we have a concept called Patient. Our Patient concept also has concepts which describe it - one which we don't have yet but want is biological `sex`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, how does one know what the concept `sex` actually means semantically? And what kinds of values the attribute `sex` on Patient can take on? This is exactly what a terminology service or ontology defines. It also defines how concepts are related to each other (i.e. tree like, graph like, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Same concept in different ontologies**\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept can be defined in multiple ontologies. For example, try the following search in your browser to see which ontologies the term `sex` is included in:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/search?q=sex&groupField=iri&start=0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coded Value\n",
    "In FHIR a `code` is an alphanumeric string (e.g. \"433152004\") used to unambiguously identify a specific concept (e.g. the concept \"male\", defined as a human with X and Y chromosomes) within a particular ontology (e.g. SNOMED CT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a concept can be defined in different ontologies, and therefore take on different values, we must always specify which ontology or system it comes from.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will hear the term **\"coded value\"** used in FHIR documentation. This phrase refers to a pairing of the `code` and the `system` from which it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Types for Coded Values\n",
    "In FHIR there are different data types that can be used to represent coded values. \n",
    "\n",
    "**code**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the simplest one, as it is just an alphanumeric string representing the code and not the system. The system is supposed to be implied based on the context the code appears in:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"code\": \"433152004\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifies the code, the system in which the code is defined (a valid URI), version of the system, and a human friendly string describing the concept which the code identifies. \n",

    "This data type combines things. It includes 1) a list of `Coding` instances and 2) a human friendly string describing the concept. \n",
    "\n",
