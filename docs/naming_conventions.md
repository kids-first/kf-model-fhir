# Naming Conventions in Kids First FHIR Data Model

This document describes the naming conventions for ids and
the file names for resources in the Kids First FHIR data model.

## Resource Id

### Semantics

The `id` attribute for a resource in the FHIR model should be
populated with some kind of logical value that describes the semantics of
the resource (e.g. `ResearchParticipant` vs `2349703`).

**NOTE:** This ONLY applies to the files in the FHIR model. Non-conformance
resources (representing real data) loaded into the FHIR server will likely
have an autogenerated alphanumeric ID which may or may not be random.

### Syntax

The `id` value should conform to the regex pattern in the
[FHIR spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/datatypes.html#id).

### Casing

All resource `id` values should have the same casing. There does not seem
to be a consistent standard or recommendation for this, but we should pick
one and stick to it.

Based on observations, the FHIR spec seems to use PascalCase for
resource types (e.g. `Patient`, `SearchParameter`) and camelCase
(e.g. `gender`, `birthDate`) for resource attributes.

The Kids First resource `id` values will be lowercased with hyphens between
words (e.g. `age-at-event`, `sequencing-experiment`).  


## Resource File Name

All resource file names should follow the pattern expected by the IG Publisher:

**Pattern**
```
<resource type>-<resource id>.json
```

### File Name Delimiter

The file name delimiter will be a hyphen `-`.

**Example StructureDefinition Resource**
```json
{
  "resourceType": "StructureDefinition",
  "id": "participant",
  "url": "https://fhir.kids-first.io/StructureDefinition/participant",
  "name": "participant",
  "status": "draft",
  "fhirVersion": "4.0.0",
  "kind": "resource",
  "abstract": false,
  "type": "Patient",
  "baseDefinition": "https://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Patient",
  "derivation": "constraint",
  "differential": {
    "element": [
      {
        "id": "Patient.gender",
        "path": "Patient.gender",
        "min": 1
      },
      {
        "id": "Patient.birthDate",
        "path": "Patient.birthDate",
        "max": "0"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**File Name Example**
```
StructureDefinition-participant.json
```

**Example Patient**
```json
{
    "resourceType":"Patient",
    "id": "pt-001",
    "meta": {
        "profile": [
            "https://fhir.kids-first.io/StructureDefinition/participant"
        ]
    },
    "gender": "female",
    "name": [
        {
            "family":"Smith"
        }
    ]
}
```

**File Name Example**
```
Patient-pt-001.json
```


## Other Things to Keep in Mind

### SearchParameter Generation

We will autogenerate search parameters off of our extensions. The `id`
will be used as the `SearchParameter.code` (the term used in the
query part of the URL).

Example:
```
/Observation?_profile=<Phenotype url>&age-at-event=10
```
